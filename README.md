ccb-exit
========

Its __UNSTABLE__.

cb-exit - python + c = ccb-exit

I made this little code maybe a year ago when I used crunchbang. I wanted
to publish this also but for some reason i haven't ... 

I don't like "standard" system tools written in python or any other imperative 
language (which doesn't mean that I hate them). So I created a fast 
raw code to use it. I did it completely unprofessional. I want to tweak on 
the code as soon as possible in order to make it nice :)
